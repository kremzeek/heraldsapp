Heralds Of Chaos Unofficial App



This is an UNOFFICIAL Android Client for Heralds of Chaos.

This is not approved by the management of Gaia.  It's not unapproved, either.  I did drop them a line much earlier asking if they had any interest and didn't get a response. I hope to get one now.

This is a Minimal Viable Product.  If you don't know how to use an APK, or want things polished, don't continue.


FAQ.
====

1. Is this official?

**No!**  Gaia has not approved this.

2. Do you need my username/password?

Unfortunately, the application needs it to log on.

3. Isn't that dangerous for me?

Yes. If you did ask this question, you should feel good about yourself. If I was a hostile entity, I could steal lots of stuff from your character given the password.

4. So will you?

No. I'm a professional software developer and it's not worth the damage to my career to get a few tens of dollars of your Gaia stuff, or even hundreds of dollars of stuff from a bunch of people.

Still, you could change your password to something temporary, use it to log in with this app, and then change back to your original in your web browser. Were I hostile, that would give me only a tiny window to steal your items. I won't, but you should be paranoid.  You could also experiment with your mule with no items.

5. Is there some other way to handle authentication?

Ideally in the long term Gaia will just acquire this project, and then they would be in charge of it.  That is not our situation currently.

But, in the meantime, it's possible for me to try to import your cookies. That would significantly limit what I could do were I hostile.  This might be too annoying to implement.  If you have ideas about this, let me know.

6. How do I install it?

I have an APK file <a href="">here</a>.  If you don't know what an APK file is or how to install one, you probably shouldn't be messing with this for the time being. 

7. I can't buy cards/edit armies/use chaos keys/do some certain special attack!  I can't see the graphics!  What's wrong?

Nothing.  This is a minimum viable product. I want to make sure that battles can work.  It's not even version 1 yet.  I aim for functionality over prettiness.

8. How can I reach you?

PM kremzeek on Gaia.  I hope to have a thread for bug reports, too, in the HoC forums somewhere.

9. Are you charging for this?

Not at present.  I do not intend to put in ads. 

10. So is this an official Gaia product?

**NO!**
