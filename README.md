Heralds Of Chaos Unofficial App



This is an UNOFFICIAL Android Client for Heralds of Chaos.

This is not approved by the management of Gaia.  It's not unapproved, either.  I did drop them a line much earlier asking if they had any interest and didn't get a response. 

This is a Minimal Viable Product.  If you don't know how to use an APK, don't know how to grab cookies from your browser, or want things polished, don't continue.


FAQ.
====

1. Is this official?

    **No!**  Gaia has not approved this.

2. Do you need my username/password?

    The app needs your cookies.  I have a [help document](cookies.md) describing how to get them.  

3. How dangerous is this?

    If I were hostile, I could do the same things someone could do to your Gaia account if you walked away from your computer.  Anything that requires a password won't work because I don't have it.

4. Will you have username/password login?

    Yes.  I technically got that working first, but I didn't want to just throw something out there asking for a username and password.

    Ideally in the long term Gaia will just acquire this project, and then they would be in charge of it.  That is not our situation currently.  Second-best would be an API key so that there could give your username/password only for Heralds Of Chaos.

5. How do I install it?

    I have an APK file <a href="cookie">here</a>.  If you don't know what an APK file is or how to install one, you probably shouldn't be messing with this for the time being. 

6. I can't buy cards/edit armies/use chaos keys/do special attack!  I can't see the graphics!  What's wrong?

    Nothing.  This is a minimum viable product. I want to make sure that battles can work.  It's not even version 1 yet.  I aim for functionality over prettiness.

7. How can I reach you?

    PM kremzeek on Gaia.  I hope to have a thread for bug reports, too, in the HoC forums somewhere.

8. Are you charging for this?

    Not at present.  I do not intend to put in ads. 

9. So is this an official Gaia product?

    **NO!**
