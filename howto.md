How to play
===========

1. You've installed [it](thing.apk), right?  Good.

2. If you have not inputted your [cookies](cookies.md) yet, click on "Users" and do so.  Yeah, this is a pain.  I'm trying not to make waves all at once. Sorry.
 After you put them all in, hit "Done".

3. On your computer, start a Heralds of Chaos match. I highly recommend single-player, and I highly recommend you choose the easiest match against Mage Orion. Start the match and let it load up enough that you are asked if you want to mulligan your cards.

4. Back to the app.  Hit "Login".  It should show "Check Game" (as "Chk Gm") now.

5. Hit "Check Game."  On the top of the app will be the list of your cards.  You can click on one, and then you can Summon or Discard it.  If you Summon it, it will automatically go to your first slot.

You cannot discard a card that you cannot summon.  Sorry.

You also cannot move your units.  I know how to do this, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.  

6. When you want to end your turn, hit "End Turn."

7. If there is a battle, instead the button will say "Start Battle."  Go on. Press it.  You know you want to.

8.  Press "Step Battle" several times, and then press "Check Game".  If the battle is still ongoing, it will still say "Step Battle."  Repeat this step.  Otherwise...

9. Press "End Battle".  Then press "Check Game"

10. In order to claim your end-of-battle rewards, you will need to go back to your computer before you finish the final battle.  Otherwise they float away.
